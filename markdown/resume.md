Technical Experience
--------------------

Programming Languages
:   **Python** has been my weapon of choice for solving everyday challenges. I like to think if it can't be solved with Python, then it isn't worth solving! During my time as a Data Coordinator, I used a Python library to connect to the organization's Oracle database and ran saved read queries to quickly gather data. The **Pandas** library helped me rapidly respond to ad hoc requests. 

    **Postgre SQL:** I read a book on PostgreSQL to broaden my knowledge on the subject. Among the topics covered were: database organization, development, maintenance, indexing, CTEs, and much more. I completed a [project](https://github.com/wilfredrial/portfolio_projects/blob/main/sql_census_2020-2022/us_counties.sql) with Postgre exploring Census population changes between 2020 and 2022.
